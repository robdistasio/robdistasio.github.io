							May 2021<br>
							<h7>The Bauer Scholarship Award is given to graduate students (going into their final year of study at Cornell) who have demonstrated scientific and educational excellence as well as communication skills.​ This award provides them with the opportunity to give a research presentation at their alma mater, covering travel expenses, a two-day hotel stay, and a per diem for a trip that has to be made before the end of May the following year. The format for the research presentation will be determined by the host institution and can range from a group meeting to a departmental talk.</h7><br><br>

							Cornell Chronicle, February 12, 2020<br>
							<h7>Assistant professors Damek Davis, Christina Delimitrou and Robert A. DiStasio Jr. have won 2020 Sloan Research Fellowships from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. The fellowships support early-career faculty members’ original research and education related to science, technology, mathematics and economics. They are among the 126 researchers in the United States and Canada who received two-year, $75,000 fellowships to advance their work. “A Sloan research fellow is someone whose drive, creativity and insight makes them a researcher to watch,” said Adam F. Falk, president of the Sloan Foundation.</h7><br><br>
